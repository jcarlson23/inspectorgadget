## Inspector Gadget

This tool attempts to find non-deterministic constraint logic gadgets within LLVM IR.  The pursuit of this
work is to find gadgets within dis-similar source but similar logic.  While functional programming allows
for more automated proof capabilities the underlying logic of the program.
