## Inspector Gadget

This tool attempts to find non-deterministic constraint logic gadgets within LLVM IR.  The pursuit of this
work is to find gadgets within dis-similar source but similar logic.  While functional programming allows
for more automated proof capabilities the underlying logic of the program.

### Goals

The goals of this research is to find those logical similarities and subtleties that architects and
researchers would be interested for finding bugs, improper logic, and so forth.

### Building

The 'build.sh' script is useful as a driver to build either a Release and/or Debug versions of the
libraries and tools.
